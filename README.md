# Basketball-Points
This is a C project, that reads from a file named (i11f9.dat) the number of a player, 
their full name and the points they scored.

After that, a new file is created with the full name of the players & their points next to their name.
Beneath that, are the total points scored and the number of the players with 10 or more points scored.
